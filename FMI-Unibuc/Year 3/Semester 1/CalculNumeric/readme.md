Disclaimer: Not for the light-hearted! 

It is a tough course about Machine Learning, Numerical Analysis and in a nutshell lots of math, but all in all I am super glad I took it. I got to learn more about the concepts that I couldn't understand from the last year's ML course and many more.
40% Lab + 10% Seminars + 50% Exam.

Lab >= 5, Exam >= 5, and overall >= 5.

But the marking wasn't strict either, as an idea I had more than 10 on the exam. 
The lecturers were super nice and I got to learn really cool stuff.
