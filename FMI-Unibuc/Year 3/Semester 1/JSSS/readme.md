I highly recommend this! The guys that were teaching were super chill, and it is very useful. It's 40% homework assignments (which is not that hard) and 60% project which is very ok too. So yeah, great choice if you want to learn some JS, Node and how an API works and how to build one (REST and GraphQL).
